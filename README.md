## How this Works

This repository contains several poorly written pieces of code across a number of langauges/libraries/discplines.

Allow the candidate to choose one option (graphql, node or react) and send them the relevant code 2-3 days in advance of their interview.

Provide the candidate the following directions:

- This code has an endless number of opportunties to improve it.
- Keep in mind
  - We don't expect you to find all of the issues or do a perfect code review in 30 miuntes
  - There are no trick questions
  - There are no specific right answers that we're looking for here

> **This is just a chance for us to have a (hopefully) low-stress 1-on-1 converstaion where we can talk shop and get a sense of how it might be working together.**

With that aside, pease take some time to review the code and think of how you might improve it about what questions you may ask or suggestions you might make during a real-life code review. Be prepared to verbally discuss, make suggestions, etc on our call.
