## Reverse Code Review

In a "reverse code review", rather than you (the candidate) write code that we review, we will provide you with a piece of code which you will review.

This repository contains three code samples in graphql, node and react. Each code sample has several issues or opportunities for improvement (e.g. variable naming, general organization, readability, etc).

Based on what you're most comfortable with, **SELECT ONE** of the folders (graphql, node or react) and look over the code.

We will hopefully have provided you a link to this repository 2-3 days in advance of your technical interview, but we don't expect you to spend more than an hour looking over this repository in preparation for your technical interview.

## The Interview

The technical interview will last about an hour. 30 minutes of general conversations about your background, as well as time for us to answer any questions you have about Koda, and 30 minutes dedicated to this reverse code review.

## Please keep in mind

- There are no trick questions
- There are no specific "right answers" that we're looking for here
- These are just incomplete snippets/code samples, they will not run locally. You'll have to use a bit of imagination that they're part of a larger project
- We don't expect you to find all of the issues or do a perfect code review in 30 minutes. This is just a chance for us to have a (hopefully) low-stress 1-on-1 conversation where we can talk shop and get a sense of how it would be working together.
- Only select one of the folders (graphql, node or react). We don't expect you to review all three folders.

## Providing Your Code Review

In terms of how you deliver your review, you have a couple of options. We won't be evaluating you based on which option you choose, select whatever makes it easiest for you to think through your review, is best for your schedule, etc.

Those options are:

1. **Verbal discussion:** You can just look over the code on your own time. Then on our technical interview call, we can verbally discuss the code-- answer any questions you might have if you need more context, points of discussion, your suggestions for improvement, etc

2. **Formal PR:** If you prefer to do a more realistic/formal code review, you can fork this repo, then create a PR on your fork and invite `acomito` to reveiw it.

As far as standards for code reviews, you don't need to worry about our standards/preferences at Koda-- you can use ones that you're familiar with from the past or your own huersistics around good coding practices. We're evaluating you on your command of the code, ability to deliver cordial criticism, and thought processes around what makes good code-- not on your ability to implement our preferences.

If you want more clarification on any of this prior to your technical interview-- do not hesitate to reach out.
