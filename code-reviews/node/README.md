# Let's discuss this Node/JS code

Given the two service classes in `Services.ts` file, we're looking to see what points you bring up for discussion, what questions you ask and suggestions that you make. What would you add to this file before approving a code review?

Some things to consider as you review this code:

- There are no one right answers and everything in this file is up for debate...
- The main file to look at is `Services.ts`. The models folder are just objects to mock an ORM.

The above are not the only considerations-- but are a few things to keep in mind as you evaluate this service class.
